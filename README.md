# Royal Kludge R65 (ANSI/WIRED/PID E508)

This is ported to the new revision of the R65.
My R65 came with USB Product ID E508.

It has VIA support enabled in the default keymap.

## TODO
- Encoder up/down (pressing it works)
- Top and middle LED (bottom one is for Caps Lock)

## Stock firmware
I included a dump of the stock firmware.
